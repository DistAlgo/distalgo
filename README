# DistAlgo 

DistAlgo is a programming language for distributed algorithms. This project is
an implementation of DistAlgo on Python.

# Installation

Installation of DistAlgo is optional. DistAlgo installation is handled through
the Python distutils package. To see full usage description, type:

    `python3 setup.py --help`

## To install DistAlgo as system-wide package:

   `python3 setup.py install`

## Or, to install DistAlgo for the current user:

   `python3 setup.py install --user`

## Alternatively, you can simply add the root directory to your PYTHONPATH
   environment variable:

   `export PYTHONPATH=<PROJROOT>:${PYTHONPATH}`

After installation, the 'da' package will be available for use.

Lastly, the 'bin' subdirectory contains two scripts, 'dac' and 'dar', that
runs the compiler and runtime, respectively. These scripts takes care of
properly setting 'sys.path' so no installation or modification of PYTHONPATH
is necessary. Simply add the 'bin' directory to your PATH:

   `export PATH=<PROJROOT>/bin:${PATH}`

# Running DistAlgo

## Invoking the compiler

   To invoke the DistAlgo compiler, run the 'da.compiler' Python module:

   `python3 -m da.compiler` (or `dac` if you use the script)

## Invoking the runtime

   To run DistAlgo programs, pass the source file as an argument to the 'da'
   Python module:

   `python3 -m da <SOURCE>` (or `dar <SOURCE>` if you use the script)

To see a full description of available options, use

   `python3 -m da.compiler -h`

and

   `python3 -m da -h`
